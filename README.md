# Addon `script.reliableresume` for Kodi
## Description
This is a script that lets you continue playing a video/audio file from the position you stopped playing before. 
It is taken from kodi community:  [[RELEASE] script.reliableresume - Script to resume last played media](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=109310)

## How-To-Use:
- Install the script from the Settings->Addon menu
- Run it once from "Programs" (to have it configured for autoexec on startup)
- Restart XBMC/Kodi
- Now the script should be running and tracking the audio files you are playing. Use the configuration dialog of the script to enable it for video too or change other parameteres
- After playing run it again from "Programs" to have it resume your last played media
